# Bubble-Sort
This project implements a bubble sort routine in ARM assembly, designed to be called from a C program. The assembly code sorts an integer array in place, using ARM instructions for efficient comparison and swapping. It's ideal for performance-critical tasks, highlighting the integration between low-level assembly and high-level C code.
